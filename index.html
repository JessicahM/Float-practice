    <h2><strong>Origin of Of Monsters And Men</strong></h2>
    <h3>Formation and early work (2009.10)</h3>
    <p>The band's origins began in 2009 when Nanna Bryndis decided to add to her solo project, Songbird. Of Monsters and Men entered 2010s Músíktilraunir, an annual music competition held in Iceland, as a quartet with members Nanna (lead vocals, acoustic guitar), Brynjar (electric guitar), Raggi (backing vocals, melodica, glockenspiel), and Arnar (backing vocals, melodica, glockenspiel, tambourine). Raggi came up with the band name, Of Monsters and Men, and everyone else liked it, so it stuck. Following Músiktilraunir, the quartet added two more members, Árni (accordion/keys, backing vocals) and Kristján (bass, backing vocals), and continued to tour venues in Iceland and work on new songs.[10] They were invited to perform at the 2010 Iceland Airwaves festival, and it is there that the Seattle-based radio station KEXP recorded the band performing Little Talks from a living room session.</p>
